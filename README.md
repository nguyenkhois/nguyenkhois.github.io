This is my page on GitHub and you can find me on [vLexikon](http://www.vlexikon.com) (Swedish-Vietnamese dictionary) as my life project. I'm also on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khoi-le-b5225814b/). I would like to receive feedback from you on what is about web programming. I always love it! (^_~)
