This is my page on GitHub and you can also find me on [vLexikon.com](https://www.vlexikon.com) (Swedish-Vietnamese dictionary) as my life project. I'm also on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khoi-le-b5225814b/). I would like to receive feedback from you on what is about web programming. I always love it! (^_~)

## **Projects**
* [Swedish-Vietnamese dictionary](https://www.vlexikon.com) (Using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, ASP.NET C#, Microsoft SQL Server)
I make this dictionary for myself och other who want teach them self about Swedish because it is too hard to look for an Swedish-Vietnamese dictionary which is simple and effective to use and work fine on smartphone, computer and always online.
